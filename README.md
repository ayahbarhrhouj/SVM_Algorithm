Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems.

The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
